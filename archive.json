That must not be shared anywhere. For systems of record for that agency, this data was toxic and any leakage was an immediate incident. Details below.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/MedicareProviderSupEnroll/downloads/EnrollmentNPI.pdf\r\n\r\nI am willing to help add to the draft and consider privacy considerations around this potentially.",

      "body": "I believe that there is a need for businesses to be able to add additional local identifiers or data to a glue id.    As an example,  we might want to say the business identifier is Dunn & Bradstreet company 12345, factor 52B.  For companies with many global business identities and many factories (for example), it may be important to say that a given factory is identified relative to a given business identifier.  In this case for example do we want the glue id for a factory certified in France under the french business identifier 12345 as 52B to be \"glue:dun.12345#52B\".  The guidance here would be for anyone resolving to remove the fragment prior to validating/resolving the number at Dunn & Bradstreet.  I do not think the fragment needs to be technically resolveable, it may be that only the business owner knows what 52B means, or it is also possible that the company's factory identifiers are public and available for further lookup.   Note that some business authorities have this kind of granularity already built into the identifier, but there still may be internal context that businesses want to add.  The obvious downside is that should we decide a fragment is a good idea, it would make the identifiers longer.",
