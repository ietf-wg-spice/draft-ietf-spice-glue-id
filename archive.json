That must not be shared anywhere. For systems of record for that agency, this data was toxic and any leakage was an immediate incident. Details below.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/MedicareProviderSupEnroll/downloads/EnrollmentNPI.pdf\r\n\r\nI am willing to help add to the draft and consider privacy considerations around this potentially.",
