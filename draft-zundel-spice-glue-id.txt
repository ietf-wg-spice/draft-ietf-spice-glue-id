1.  Introduction

   Enterprise entity identifiers are myriad.  With the increasing use of
   digitial credentials, there is a need for a common methodology for
   expressing these identifiers such that claims about and by such
   entities can be made in a consistent and interoperable manner.

   This specification defines a URI scheme that standardizes the
   expression of existing company entity identifers and establishes a
   registry for managing how these existing identifiers relate to this
   scheme.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   For the remainder of this document, the term "glue URI" is used to
   refer to a URI that uses the glue scheme.

   TODO: define external authority, company entity

3.  Core Concepts

   Every glue URI, whether expressed as a string or encoded in binary
   MUST be comprised of the following components:

   *  The Authority Identifier

   *  The External Number

   The Authority Identifier indicates the external authority responsible
   for assigning the External Number and the scheme used to do so.

   The External Number is the identifier assigned to the company by the
   external authority.

4.  Text Encoding of glue URIs

   All glue URIs comply with [RFC3986] and are therefore represented by
   a scheme identifier and a scheme-specific part.  The scheme
   identifier is: glue, and the scheme-specific parts are represented as
   a sequence of alphanumeric components separated by the '.' character.
   A formal definition is provided in the next section, but it can
   informally be considered as:

   glue:<authority-identifier>.<external-number>

   The Authority Identifier MUST be an alphanumeric string from the
   "Scheme" field of the glue URI Authority Identifier registry.  The
   External Number MUST be the identifier assigned to the company by the
   external authority under the identified scheme.

4.1.  glue URI Scheme Text Syntax

   TODO ABNF

5.  DIDs and glue

   TODO DIDs and glue

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

7.  Privacy Considerations

7.1.  Private identifiers as corporate identifiers

   There are some corporate identifers which make use of personal
   identifiers.  This is the case for registered sole-proprietor
   businesses in much of the United States, where the business
   identifier may be the same as the social-security-number of the
   business owner.

   It is possible for such identifers to be represented as glue URIs.
   An identifier's expression as a glue URI does not change the privacy
   characteristics of that identifier.  The same cautions and concerns
   need to be taken with the glue URI representation as with the
   original identifier.

   Implementers storing or evaluating glue ids are encouraged to
   evaluate the privacy characteristics of each identification scheme
   represented by an authority identifier and to appropriately handle
   any glue id which violates privacy policies.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following sections detail requests to IANA for the creation of a
   new registry and registration of the 'glue' URI scheme.

8.1.  'glue' URI Scheme Registration

   TODO

8.2.  'glue' Scheme URI authority registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "'glue' Scheme
   URI Authority Identifiers".  The registration policy for this
   registry is Expert Review as defined in [RFC8126].

   Each entry in this registry associates one or more Authority
   Identifiers with a single organization.  Within the registry, the
   organization is identified using the "Name" field.  Each identified
   organization will be associated with one or more number of company
   identification schemes, which are listed in the "Scheme" field.  A
   reference for each scheme is listed in the "Reference" field of the
   registry.

   The initial values for the registry are:

+==================+========+===========================================+
| Name             | Scheme | Reference                                 |

   ### Guidance for Designated Experts

   It is not required that registration of an Authority Identifier be
   done by a representative of the external authority.

8.3.  URI Scheme Registration

   The "glue" URI scheme is requested to be registered in the
   provisional "URI Schemes" registry.  The information below is
   provided according to the guidelines from RFC 4395: * URI scheme
   name: glue * Status: provisional * URI scheme syntax: See Section 4.1
   of Text Encoding of glue URIs (Section 4)
